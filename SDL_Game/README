THIS PROJECT ONLY WORKS ON LINUX CURRENTLY. 

TO USE:

    Install SDL2, and GLEW, and make.
    
    Navigate to the SDL_Game directory
    
    Run "make clean" then run "make". This compiles the program using your system's library headers into a runnable binary called sdlgame.
    
    run "./sdlgame"
    
    
    

SDL already includes OpenGL headers if installed correctly.
